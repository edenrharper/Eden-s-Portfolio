<h1>The Best Movies According to Eden</h1>
<h3>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h3>
<hr/>
<h3>Inside Out 2</h3>
<p>This is my favorite Pixar movie at the moment. I really loved how it showed us how all emotions are good for you, even the ones that we don't think are super great.</p>
<h3>High School Musical</h3>
<p>I know this movie might be considered a bit old, but it is just a classic.</p>
<h3>Descendants Rise of the Red</h3>
<p>I am a fan of Descendants and I was really excited when they released a fourth one. Despite them introducing all new characters, I thought it was really good overall.</p>
